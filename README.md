# My projects

In this repository, I will present some of my projects in the context of data science and machine learning. This repository is organised as follows:

- Each project is contained in a separate folder, and includes a README.md file describing the project and the files used.
- Projects are implemented in Python (> 3.9)
- Dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file for each project.
- To understand the code of each project, the programmations is developed with Jupyter notebooks.
